---

I'm a Master's student at UMass-Amherst working on Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I got my Bachelors in Information Systems and Advanced Analytics from Singapore Management University in 2019.

I work on Continual Learning and Few-shot Learning in Language Generation. I am also interested in applying these concepts to the Task-driven Conversational AI setting.

I was formerly a Systems Analyst at Visa in Singapore where I worked with upper management and technology teams to come up with data-driven business process optimization solutions. I also got to dip my toes in Project Management, Migration Projects and Program Management. 

As an intern at Visa as a Systems Analyst, I built a Business Value Analysis Tool to quantify the financial and overall strategic value of business products on the fly.

Before that, I was an intern at KeyReply where I worked as an NLP Research Intern and designed a language model to augment domain specific data using Transfer Learning.

In a former life, I also did some Business Process Improvement work as a Student Consultant with UOB-SMU Asian Enterprise Institute. I still love these projects but they are more of a hobby and mostly directed towards the companies of my friends and family.
